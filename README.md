Momentum Strategy implemented in Backtrader for newbies

Since it is based on Teddy Kokers Momentum Strategy as well as two Backtrader blog posts, I would like to express my thankfulness to Teddy Koker and the creator of Backtrader, Daniel Rodriguez!

Features are currently depicted in the Jupyter notebook file. In the beginning i didn't like to use it but some grafical features, i.e. pyfolio, only work within Jupyter so please do not give up here.
I will add a series of versions and each of them works according to what I remeber. I think this might help to understand the features I added later on better.
